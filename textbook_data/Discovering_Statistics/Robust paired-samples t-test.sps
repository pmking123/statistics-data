*Runs the robust t-test. For your own use you will need to change 'No_Cloak' and 'Cloak' to be the variable names (from your SPSS file) for the two conditions that you want to compare.
* It's important that you leave mySPSSdata$ before the variab;le names (and no space after the $).

BEGIN PROGRAM R.
library(WRS2)
mySPSSdata = spssdata.GetDataFromSPSS() 
yuend(mySPSSdata$No_Cloak, mySPSSdata$Cloak, tr = 0.2)
END PROGRAM.
