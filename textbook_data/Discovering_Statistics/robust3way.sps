*This function computes robust tests of three-way independent factorial designs.
* It compares trimmed means (Wilcox, 2012).
* For your own use you will need to change 'outcome', 'predictorA', 'predictorB' and 'CredictorA' to be the variable names (from your SPSS file) for your outcome and three predictors.

BEGIN PROGRAM R.
library(WRS2)
mySPSSdata =  spssdata.GetDataFromSPSS(factorMode = "labels")
t3way(outcome ~ predictorA*predictorB*predictorC, data = mySPSSdata, tr = 0.2)
END PROGRAM.
